# allied-health-searches
This is a work-in-progress collection of common keyword search strings I use in allied health disciplines.

Search syntax and subject headings have been customised for each database as identified, including PubMed, Embase (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO). Depending on the topic other databases are ocassionally included such as ERIC (EBSCO).
I highly recommend the <a href="https://sr-accelerator.com/#/polyglot">PolyGlot</a> search translator for converting syntax from PubMed to other databases (subject headings will need to be changed manually according to the database thesarus if it doesn't use MeSH).
