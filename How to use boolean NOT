e.g. to exclude aticles about animals. 

S1. My search (articles I want)
S2. animal NOT human (articles I don't want)
S3. S1 NOT S2

Q: Why not simply add "NOT animals" to the search? 
A: It will exclude articles about both animal and human (you still want the human articles).

Q: Isn't this a double negative? Why not search "AND human"?
A: some relevant articles might not have the word "human" indexed- it is implied.
